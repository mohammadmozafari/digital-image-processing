# Traffic Sign Recognition
This project aims to create an end-to-end system that can both detect and classify traffic signs in roads. Although the state-of-the-art methods for doing this use the new artificial neural networks, our goal was to take advantage of the image processing techniques such as template matching and etc. We also attempted to reverse the effect of **motion blur** as well as we could.
